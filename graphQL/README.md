#### Language taught this evening GraphQL


##### What is it?

Changes how you interact with APIs
Started with Facebook (Developed by them) and has to do with how you tailor your queries
A way you can query an API
You can write it like a SQL query

##### Server side

Restful Apis are HTTP based RestApis

Client sends request and the server returns

get (receives a response)
put (update)
post (create something new)
SOAP is also a Restful API

##### GraphQL vs RestAPI


RestApi you are stuck with all the ingredients on the sandwich

GraphQL gives you the ability to build your own sandwich



##### Using a library called Graphene (Python with Graphql)


You can also use the GraphQL playground

This uses SQL syntax though
